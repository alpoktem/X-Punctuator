i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday <NUM> december <NUM> and i would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period 
you have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days during this part-session 
madam president on a point of order 
you will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in sri lanka 
one of the people assassinated very recently in sri lanka was mr kumar ponnambalam who had visited the european parliament just a few months ago 
would it be appropriate for you madam president to write a letter to the sri lankan president expressing parliament's regret at his and the other violent deaths in sri lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation 
yes mr evans i feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate 
if the house agrees i shall do as mr evans has suggested 
madam president on a point of order 
i would like your advice about rule <NUM> concerning inadmissibility 
my question relates to something that will come up on thursday and which i will then raise again 
the cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before parliament on thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph <NUM> that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually 
it says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability 
i believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible 
i want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report not a legislative proposal and whether that is something i can competently do on thursday 
that is precisely the time when you may if you wish raise this question i.e on thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report 
we shall call him mr hicks 
at the request of a french member mr zimeray a petition has already been presented which many people signed including myself 
however i would ask you in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the european parliament and by the whole of the european community to make representations using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent to the president and to the governor of texas mr bush who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person 
this is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld
